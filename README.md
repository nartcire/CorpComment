## Motivation

This project is a simple HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS project that makes use of query selectors and other basic syntax of javascript. Wanting to reinforce basic ideas in Vanilla JS and making fun small projects! This project also dives into hooking into APIs with the fetch command in JS and how to resolve promises and utilize APIs for GET and POST requests. 

## Description

The website is a simple review/feedback website where users can drop feedback on various companies they want to speak to. Users can write their feedback with the #company-name so that the review can be directed to the right company. The review is also stored in an API and all reviews are fetched from the same API. I did not make the API nor the HTML/CSS portion of the project, but I focused exclusively on the Vanilla JS portion of the project as well as a little bit of the animations of the CSS. Additionally, users can expand the reviews if not all of the text fits nicely into their review section and can upvote on reviews. Updates to the upvotes are not recorded to the API.
